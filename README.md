# Welcome

Hello and welcome to mieyaou.nvim, a coarse-grained configuration wrapper for neovim which allows users to have a stable but modular configuration. The name is an inside joke, which evolved from the word "meow," but was translated to the French "miaou" and later became "mieyaou" for the sake of including all of the vowels (because it was funny).
